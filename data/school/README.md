- If circulo is not installed, be sure to set the PYTHONPATH to the project home directory, otherwise the circulo package will not be found

###Data Prep

__Requirements__

- NetworkX from https://networkx.github.io
- iGraph from http://igraph.org


The data can be found at [http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/primary-school-cumulative-networks/](http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/primary-school-cumulative-networks/)


To download and extract the two data sets, do the following:

	`python run.py`
	
This should create a new directory, "data", if it doesn't already exist, and populate it with the new data in .gexf and .graphml format.
	

__Code__

- Please refer to run.py
